Intro: 
Ever gone camping and wondered what animals were around you? Limited cell service, SD cards are too time intensive, and wifi's range is too limited. Introducing a custom trail camera featuring a lora rasberry pi hat PCB and worlds first open source lora video streaming protocol written in python. I literally wrote the code so an image can be converted into bytes, turned into radio frequencies, and subsequently decoded up to 2 miles away. Images take less than a minute to be sent and can be sorted with a modified version of PyTorch Wildlife. 

Motivation: 
Really wanted to do a big project (after doing many small ones) and this one was accessible, interesting, and made the world a better place. I took a prototype of this on Hackclub's the trail.

Challenges:
- didn't know what a pcb was -> learned how to use easyeda
- first pcb had the wrong ipex connector -> bought new ipex connector
- first pcb's moduels came dead on arrival -> created second pcb
- second pcb had a component in the wrong orientation -> individually desodered a 40 pin header, broke it, and resodered only the metal bits that were needed
- webcam drivers weren't working -> used ffmpeg
- base64 encoding wasn't working -> used pil library
- some packets were being missed  -> increased wait time between packets

How it works:

# PCB âœ”

I created a PCB that easily connects a lora module with a sx1278 chip to a rasberry pi 3. This is much better than the jumper wires I prototyped because its much more portable.
