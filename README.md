Imagine a wildlife camera that can send images of wildlife entirely through radio waves. This system is currently being built for the The Trail. I spent 2-3 weeks for the idea stage, then bought 2 rasberry pi's and 2 lora modules from amazon. I spent a long time trying to connect 2 rasberry pi's which had lora moduels attached via jumper wires together with lora. Then I watched many vidoes on easy eda and made the pcb.

I created a PCB that easily connects a lora module with a sx1278 chip to a rasberry pi 3. This is much better than the jumper wires I prototyped because its much more portable.
